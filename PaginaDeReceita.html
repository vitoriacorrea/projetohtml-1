<li>500-700g icing sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven to 180ยบ. Grease and flour three 18 cm round cake tins.</li>

<li>In a bowl, mix the eggs, oil, vinegar, vanilla and yogurt. Beat with a whisk.</li>

<li>In another bowl, mix the flour, sugar, cocoa and baking powder.</li>

<li>Combine the two mixtures, mixing until smooth.</li>

<li>Finally, add three drops of red food coloring and stir. If it is still light, add more drops little by little. Be careful, as the batter tends to get darker after baking.</li>

<li>Divide the batter into the tins, with equal amounts in each one. Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool before decorating.</li>

<li>In a mixer, on medium speed, beat the cream cheese and butter until creamy.</li>

<li>Add vanilla and gradually add sugar until you get the desired texture. Remember that the more sugar, the firmer it will be.</li>

<li>Assemble the cake with a layer of cream between the batters.</li>

<li>Then, cover with the remaining cream.</li>

<li>Decorate with red fruits or crumbs from the cake itself.</li>
